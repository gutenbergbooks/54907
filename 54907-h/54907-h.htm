<span class="ih">The promontoried porch of Attica,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past evenfall, sat he whose reverend hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down-glittered with the breaker’s volleying foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visioned before him in the level dark:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ægeus, of wronged Pandion heir, and king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round about his knees, and at his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In saffrons and sad greens alone bedight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat, clustered in dim wayward sidelong groups<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer to the ocean’s edge, those liegemen fond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with him wished and wept. As thro’ the hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ebbing autumn, on a northward hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies summer’s russet ruined panoply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knotted and heaped by the fantastic winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hap-hazard, while the first adventuring snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Globes itself on the summit; so they clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure among the rangèd crevices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Month after month, and wakeful night on night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vigilant; ever neighbored and o’ertopped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that white presence, and the boding sky.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Ægeus prayed: ‘O give me back but him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My desert palm, my moorland mid-day fount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My leopard-foot, in equal tameless grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swaying suavely down cool garden-paths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or into battle’s maw: my lad of Athens!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bronze and tangly curls a-toss, to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infancy’s golden-silken underglow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glad eye dusking blue, as is the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere fiery sunset tricks it; and the lashes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one close sombre file against his cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enphalanxed in perpetual trail and droop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherethro’ gleams laughter as thro’ sorrow’s pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anger’s self doth tremble maidenly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The massy throat; the nostril mobile, smooth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breast full-orbed with arduous large pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I so oft have marked, when from the chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The witness-dropping knife swung with the bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heading the burdened company, he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye vermeil with the wholesome wind, outwrestler<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of storms and perils all. High-mettled Theseus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keystone of greatness, bond of expectation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay of this realm! in his strong-sinewed beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear unto men as Tanais bright-sanded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose flood harmonious lapses on the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And makes for hearts yoke-wearied, thither roaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice feastful holiday. Ah, righteous gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forasmuch as I love him and await him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from my youth have been your servitor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield my old age its boon of vindication:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haven the happy ship here, ere I die.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still heedlessly the hushed moon bent her bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the unshorn forest oakenry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dense gladiate leaves of Thoræ’s pine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold and incommunicable moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waxing and waning thro’ the barren time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brought not Theseus’ self, nor of him sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any waif of rumor out of Crete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto, a year nigh gone, the ship had sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn; her decks enshrouded in plucked yew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strewn to the mizzen; and her oary props<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halyards all with blossomed myrtle twined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every sail dark as from looms of hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token of the universal dole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her heavèd anchor and spurred keel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheers none, but protest, moans, and ire attended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the quay, in melancholy weather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forward she sobbed on black unwilling wing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ere that going drear, one foot ashore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theseus with his mild comrades hand in hand,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seven maids and boys to bondage sealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted his head, and met his father’s eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of morning ardor made this oath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘My people, stand not for our sakes in tears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No shape of ill shall daunt me; I will strike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overcome, Heaven’s favor for my shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when engirt with conquest I return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Or never else hies Theseus hitherward),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye may read my heart while yet at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know indeed that fate hath used me fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these your lambs I shepherd and lead home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, I will set upon the central mast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky-sail white! white to the hollowing breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White to that fierce and alien coast, and white<br /></span>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
